Please credit me in any derivative works (I don't mind where, just a 
mention in the license agreement is fine).  Do what you like with this 
code but do so under the following caution:

DISCLAIMER:
This software (i.e. the MergeFS source and/or program) is provided as-is, without 
any warranty, implied or otherwise.  The software is provided in good faith, and while I,
Harry Rose, have checked it for bugs, I make no claims as to having found them all,
and furthermore, bugs that I have already found might not yet have been fixed.

Due to the fact that this software manipulates files on disk, there is a real risk
that a bug might cause loss of data.  Consequently, the user is advised to thoroughly
test the software on a system in which such data loss is inconsequential.  Even then,
use of this software is done so AT THE USER'S OWN RISK.

You have been warned ;-)

LESS SCARY:
I do actually run this software on my home computer, I even test `unstable' versions 
of the code on it.  Although, this isn't a guarantee that the software won't break 
something :-P
